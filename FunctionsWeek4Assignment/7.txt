Q7: Explore:
Can the same function name be used for different functions without any conflict?

ans: Same funtion name can be used for different functions without conflict only if they either have different
     data types for arguments or different number of arguments. Same function names cannot be used if functions 
     differ only by their return type because the compiler would not then know which function is to be used.
