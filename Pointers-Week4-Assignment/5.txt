Q5: Is the following program snippet correct?

int a = 10, b = 20;
int *ptr;
*ptr = 5;

ans: program snippet is syntactically correct but might result in runtime error such as Segmentation Fault. This is because ptr 
     will have a garbage address which might even point to a location which does not belong to the program and hence might result in 
     Segmentation Fault when we try to access it. Such pointers are also known as Wild Pointers
