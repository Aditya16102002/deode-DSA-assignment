6. Predict the output.
int main()
{
int sub[50], i ;
for ( i = 0 ; i <= 48 ; i++ ) ;
{
sub[i] = i ;
cout<<sub[i]<<endl ;
}
return 0;
}

ans: 49
     
     With the semicolon remaining after the for loop, the loop increments i from 0 to 48, and then one additional time when i becomes 49. 
     Since the semicolon terminates the loop without executing any statements inside it, i reaches the value of 49 after the loop.
     After the loop completes, the code block following the loop is executed. Since the value of i is 49 at this point, sub[49] is 
     assigned the value of 49, and then sub[49] is printed.
